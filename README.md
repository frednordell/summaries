# Contents
Summaries of various courses from my time at LTH

# Compiling
I use pdflatex for compiling, there is a handy bash script that compiles all the summaries and puts them in a folder named compiled. The script will not work perfectly if there are other folders than the folders with the summary file in the root folder. It will also delete any folder named compiled at runtime.
